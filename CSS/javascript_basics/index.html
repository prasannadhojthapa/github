            <h2>JavaScript Basics </h2>

            JavaScript is a cross-platform, oject-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
            variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
            take it in a buch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment(a web browser or Node
            server), it can be connected to the object of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
                    coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
                    identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span> var x;</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_assignment.asp">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                    have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a
                    value to a variable, <span>var x = 10;</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://javascript.info/types">Data Types</a>Data types are an important conceptsl to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data ype. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false</span> ; <span>null</span>
                    aka nothing; Number -<span>42</span>  or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding', 2,'Dojo'];</span>
                    and Object - <span> {first_name:'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">Conditionals</a>
                     When you write a code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions -
                    hitting differenct code block based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
                    conditional statement in your code to accomplish this. There are the following condtitional
                    statements: <span>If</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if </span> to specify a
                    new condition to test, if the first conditon is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
                    essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to
                    run a mile, well you run around the track four timese and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we cll our funvtion this will run that
                    code block. Think of it as a list of instrutions. As an example imagine we are putting together a
                    desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the
                    table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there
                    are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
